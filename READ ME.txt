Installing

Warning: I've set the script up for you to store all your images in the images file. it is not neccessary to include 
the full url, instead just place your image in the /images/ directory and link them like this <img src="/images/file.png"

1.Unzip the contents
2.open /_faucet/admin_very.php and set your username and password in the provided area.
3.save the file.
4.Make all the theme modifications you need.
5.Important. If someone knows the path to your list.txt they can easily read it to combat this, i've included an 
.htaccessfile with the download
you will need to configure this file to work properly to protect unauthorized viewing of your list.
Luckily there are a number of available tutorials, but this one is best:

http://webdesign.about.com/od/htaccess/ht/password_1_file.htm

Follow the instructions in the tutorial and then upload everything to your server.
test your protected file by trying to access the list directly. for example type "http://yoursite.com/_faucet/list.txt"
if it prompts you for a password then you are good to go.

6. This is the most important step. Go to the /_faucet/ directory and chmod(777) the list.txt file. this file acts 
as your database for your info. 
If you do not take this step the verify_form.php script wont be able to write the submissions, and you will not be able 
to view or edit them in the admin.php
page.

7. As a final word, i recommend you look into adding onto the verify.php script and adding a captcha to the submission 
form to reduce spam. also you may want to look into encrypting your password
in the admin_verify.php file to protect your self from hackers.

8. This is a lightweight and portable script you should be able to build an impressive faucet on. If you use it, 
please donate.
